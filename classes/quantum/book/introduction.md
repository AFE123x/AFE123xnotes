# Chapter 1: Nomenclature and Notation

## positive operator, positive definite operator, support

- A positive operator, A, is one where $\bra{\psi}A\ket{\psi} \geq 0$ for all $\ket{\psi}$. 
- A positive definite operator A is one where $\bra{\psi}A\ket{\psi} > 0$ for all $\ket{\psi} \neq 0$.
- Support: the vector space orthogonal to the kernel.
    - the kernel(also called a **null space**) is a set of all vectors that the operator maps to the zero vector

## notation U, H

- When you see the notation U (sometimes also called V), will be used to denote a unitary operator or matrix.
- H denotes the a quantum logic gate, the Hadamard gate, and sometimes the hamiltonian for a quantum system.

## relative entropy

- The relative entropy of a positive operator A with respects to a positive operator B is defined by $S(A || B) \equiv tr(A log A) - tr (A log B)$

## modulo meaning

$\oplus$ denotes modulo two addition

## quantum gates

- unlike digital circuits, we represent quantum gates with matrices.
