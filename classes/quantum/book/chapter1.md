# Chapter 1: Nomenclature and Notation

## vector space assumptions

- We assume vector spaces are to be finit dimensional, unless otherwise noted.

## positive and positive definite operator

- These definitions categorize operators based on how they act on vectors in a Hilbert space (the state space in quantum mechanics).

- Positive Operator: An operator A is positive if the inner product ⟨ψ∣A∣ψ⟩ yields a real number greater than or equal to zero for any vector ∣ψ⟩ in the state space
    - Implication for Eigenvalues: In finite dimensions, a positive operator is necessarily Hermitian (self-adjoint), and all of its eigenvalues are real and non-negative $(λ_i \geq 0)$
