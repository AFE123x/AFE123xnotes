# Introduction

## Why should we care about quantum computing?

- opportunites: factoring, search, optimization, chemistry


**chemistry simulation**

- A molecule has n electrons.
- a classical computer will request $O(k^n)$ bits to represent n electrons.
- on a quentum computer, it'll take $O(n^P)$ qubits to represent n electrons.

- TDLR, since we can represent more values with a single bit, quantum computing will use less memory.+
