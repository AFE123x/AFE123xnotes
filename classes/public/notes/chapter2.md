## Preparation

- The biggest takeaway from chapter two is: Preparation is key.
- You should break your presentation into smaller chunks.
- Don't push presentation preparation to the last minute, as you need resources, which is difficult last minute.
- you should also understand the prompt/assignment.

## 5 Key matters

- There are five key aspects that makes a good presentation:
    - invention: generation of ideas 
        - ex: how will you do this? what does the audience look like?
        - you cannot make up fallicies, as it'd make you lose credibility
    - arrangement: You need to structure it, so it's clear and memorable. 
    - style: you need to use proper language: be clear and avoid bias.
        - if you make multiple fallacies, unecessary jargon.
    - memory: feel free to have notes for structure, don't read off it. 
    - delivery: Using your voice (high,low), hand gestures, maintain eye contact.
